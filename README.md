# Bulls-and-Cows
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows"> Bulls and cows</a> is a game where the player tries to guess the number generated by the computer based on clues given by the program. It is based on a pen paper game of the same name. The more commercially popular games "Mastermind", and "Wordle" are based on this.<br>
The rules of the game are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>A key is generated by the computer, and the player has to make guesses as to what the key is. The player wins when their guess matched the key.
  <li>The player gets twelve tries to guess what the key is.
  <li>The key has 4 digits from 0-9, and no digit is repeated. Each guess made by the player must also pertain to this rule.
  <li>A number in the players guess that is in the key in the same position as it is in the guess is called a "Bull"
  <li>A number in the players guess that is in the key but not in the same position as it is in the guess is called a "Cow"
  <li>After each guess, the player is told how many Bulls and Cows their key contains. The player must use these clues to make further guesses.
</ul>
